# Smart-Irrigation-System Using Arduino
 The Smart Agricultural Irrigation System Using Arduino is an automated solution that optimizes water usage in agriculture by monitoring and controlling soil moisture levels. This project addresses water scarcity and promotes efficient irrigation practices, enhancing plant health and crop yield while ensuring sustainable resource management.


## Abstract
This project is a precise automatic watering system for plants, using Arduino Uno. It utilizes soil moisture data to determine irrigation needs, maximizing efficiency and minimizing water waste.

## Features
- Automatic watering based on soil moisture levels
- Utilizes various sensors for accurate data
- Sustainable and efficient water usage

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- Soil moisture sensor
- Water pump
- Relay
- Micro servo motor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard

## How It Works
1. Soil moisture sensor detects moisture levels.
2. Data is sent to the Arduino.
3. If moisture is below a threshold, the water pump is activated to irrigate plants.

## Installation Instructions
1. Set up the Arduino and connect all components as shown in the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the Arduino code provided in the `code/` directory.
3. Power the system and monitor the results.

## Future Improvements
- Integration of weather-based sensors
- Remote monitoring through a mobile app
